Use git-format-patch and git-am instead of rebasing all the time - makes pushing
gitq branches work without breaking people who may have pulled it

Add qdiff - Prints current patch + working dir changes to screen

Add qapplied - Prints only the list of currently applied patches in your queue
    -1 - show only last one
    -s - show first line of patch header (first line of commit msg)

Add qseries - Prints all patches in queue (applied or not - differentiates)
    -m - show patches not in series
    -s - show first line of patch header (first line of commit msg)

Add qpop - Remove top patch from queue (won't work if working dir has changes)
    -a - remove all
    -f - trash working dir changes

Add qpush - Add next patch back to queue - This will update base (won't work if
working dir has changes)
    -a - add all
    -f - trasn working dir changes

Add qrebase? - Like rebase, but gitq safe (ie, updates base revs for each patch)
