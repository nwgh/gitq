This is a library that may (or may not) be useful in writing python-based git
extensions. It is used by git-hg (https://github.com/todesschaf/git-hg), dgit
(https://github.com/todesschaf/dgit), and maybe some other things that I haven't
listed here.

The official source distribution for this is https://github.com/todesschaf/pgl

This package requires distutils.

This is released under GPL version 2 ONLY. See the file COPYING for more info.
