This attempts to add functionality as close as possible to that of Mercurial's
MQ extension (http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension) onto git. It may
or may not succeed.

The official source distribution for this is https://github.com/todesschaf/gitq

This package requires distutils and pgl (https://github.com/todesschaf/pgl).

This is released under GPL version 2 ONLY. See the file COPYING for more info.
